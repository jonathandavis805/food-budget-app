### Food budget app ###
The goal of this repo is mostly to learn how to build a SaaS app and also might be useful to some other people in the world.

I'll be playing around with different stacks. I might try golang or rust for some of the backend stuff. I'll probably use caddy or something to handle web traffic and might try to do most of the frontend using svelte or something not React. 

If you find this helpful,
